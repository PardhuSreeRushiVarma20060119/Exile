### ⚙️ Safe Red Team Framework Emulator (v1.0.4)

> “Everything real — but fake.”  
> 🔒 **No real exploits. No actual payloads. Fully safe for learning and demonstration.**

## 📦 Modules Included

| Zone               | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `dropperlab.py`    | Simulates droppers and macro-based initial access (no real execution)       |
| `stage1.py`        | Emulates first-stage behavior like low-priv escalation and stager logic     |
| `stage2.py`        | Simulates second-stage actions: memory actions, service staging             |
| `endgame.py`       | Mimics post-exploitation: hollowing, injection, remote exec (safe emulation)|
| `payload_laboratory.py` | Fake shellcode & payload building logic for demonstration              |
| `shellcode_lab.py` | Safe representation of shellcode loaders and encoders (no real shellcode)   |
| `telemetry.py`     | Displays fake CPU/RAM/DISK/NET usage to simulate operational context        |
| `vault.py`         | Store configs/payload metadata safely (no binary content stored)            |
| `guard.py`         | Simulated behavior monitoring for payload detection/emulation               |
| `crypter.py`       | Mimics simple XOR and Base64 encoding of payloads (safe dummy data only)    |
| `dashboard.py`     | CLI launcher with ASCII logo and mode routing                               |

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Help students and developers **understand red team structure**
- Teach flow of staged compromise: from dropper to post-exploitation
- Provide a **realistic simulation** environment for framework design
- Stay **100% safe**, **exploit-free**, and **educational**

---

## 🚫 Legal Notice

> **This is a SAFEWORK variant. There are NO working exploits, shellcode, or malicious behavior. This tool is designed for educational purposes ONLY.**

If you’re looking to extend this into more advanced frameworks, use this responsibly and **never test on unauthorized systems.**

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Platform: Windows/Linux
- No external dependencies (all standard libraries)

---

## 🛠️ Running the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PardhuSreeRushiVarma20060119/Exile.git
cd exile-safework
python exile.py
```

From here, you’ll access all CLI-based modules from a main menu.

---

## 📌 Suggested Usage Flow

```
1. Build fake payload (payload_laboratory)
2. Simulate dropper (dropperlab)
3. Move through Stage1 → Stage2 → Endgame
4. Monitor simulated metrics (telemetry)
5. Archive or retrieve configs (vault)
6. Simulate Crypter & Guard modules
```
